# HeyphoneClone
A set of design files for John Hey's (G3TDZ  SK) LF radio set.

The design files have been created in pcb-rnd, the open source PCB layout editor ( http://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/ )

pcb-rnd can export to gEDA PCB, Kicad, Protel Autotrax and other file formats, as well as being able to export the usual gerber, images, postscript and so forth graphic formats.

More boards will be added as time permits.

The layouts are based on scanned TIFFs of pcb artwork located at http://bcra.org.uk/creg/heyphone/documentation.html
